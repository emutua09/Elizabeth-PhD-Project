1. Research Overview
This project utilised morphological operations to preprocess images and build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for ROP stage III disease diagnosis. 
The project was completed as a PhD research work and data obtained from Kaggle database and a private dataset from KNH hospital.The modeling is performed in PyTorch. All notebooks and a PDF report are available
