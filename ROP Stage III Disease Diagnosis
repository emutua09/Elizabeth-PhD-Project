1. Research Overview
This project utilised morphological operations to preprocess images and build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for ROP stage III disease diagnosis. 
The project was completed as a PhD research work and data obtained from Kaggle database and a private dataset from KNH hospital.The modeling is performed in PyTorch. All notebooks and a PDF report are available
2. Background Information
Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease which affects newborn babies born preterm. 
Babies born preterm, have their retina not fully developed and, in some cases, the blood vessels begins to grow abnormally.
3. ROP Stages
Stage I: A whitish demarcation line is formed
Stage II: Ridge line increases in width and height
Stage III: Abnormal growth of blood vessels, Ridgeline turns pink
Stage IV: Retina Detachment
Stage V: Blindness
