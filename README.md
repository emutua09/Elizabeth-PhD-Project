## Project summary

This PhD research developed an hybrid model combining the use of morphological operations and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for ROP stage III disease diagnosis.

Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease which affects newborn babies born preterm.

Babies born preterm, have their retina not fully developed and, in some cases, the blood vessels begins to grow abnormally.
